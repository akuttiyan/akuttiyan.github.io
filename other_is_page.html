            <p style="text-align: left; margin-right: 10px;">In the spring of junior year I decided to do an independent study on the ways that computer science is used in healthcare. I looked into the fields of data science, pharmacology, psychology, genomics, phylogenetics and clinical decision support systems.</p>
